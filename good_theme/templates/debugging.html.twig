{# Here are a bunch of ways to debug your twig templates #}

{# Dumps all of the content. Will cause a timeout a lot of the time. Not the best way to do it#}
{{ dump(content) }}

{# Dumps just your content array keys — useful if you want to see if a field even exists or not #}
{{ dump(content|keys) }}

{# Dumps all the keys for everything in the current context #}
{{ dump(_context|keys) }}

{# Kints your content #}
{{ kint(content) }}

{# If you have twig_xdebug installed and configured, this will break and show all of your variables #}
{# This is extremely dope and good if you're doing stuff like creating your own template to use in a custom module #}
{{ breakpoint() }}
